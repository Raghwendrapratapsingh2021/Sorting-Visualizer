# Sorting-Visualizer
The sorting visualizer project is a C++ program that uses SDL libraries to create a visual representation of sorting algorithms. It displays bars representing elements to be sorted and demonstrates the step-by-step sorting process.

The sorting algorithms covered here are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.
The list size is fixed to 130 elements. You can randomize the list and select any type of sorting algorithm to call on the list from the given options. 
Here, all sorting algorithms will sort the elements in ascending order.
The sorting time being visualized for an algorithm is not exactly same as their actual time complexities. 
The relatively faster algorithms like Merge Sort, etc. have been delayed so that they could be properly visualized.


# Controls:-

WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly. Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
